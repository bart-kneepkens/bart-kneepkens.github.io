        <p> Hi there. My name is Bart Kneepkens, </p>
        <p> and I'm a developer. My philosophy when it comes to making software reflects in this website; minimal, concise, and to the point. </p>
        <br>
        <blockquote> "Nothing is more simple than greatness; indeed, to be simple is to be great."
          <br><br> - Waldo Emerson
        </blockquote>
          <br>
          <!-- <p> Simplicity is the one thing I value more than well-structured code and clean desks. -->
            <!-- When writing software, the question we should always should keep asking ourselves</p> -->
          <p> Creating good experiences with software is about more than conforming to a person's or business' needs or expectations; it's about going beyond that.
              Instead of making things that <u>add to</u> life, we should aim to make things that greatly <u>improve</u> life.
              <br>
              <br>
              To make things truly simplistic and truly good, is to make things as if they are what we have always missed. </p>
