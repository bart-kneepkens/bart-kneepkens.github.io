        <p> Hi there. My name is Bart Kneepkens, </p>
        <p> and I'm a developer. My philosophy when it comes to making software reflects in this website; minimal, concise, and to the point. </p>
        <br>
        <blockquote> "Nothing is more simple than greatness; indeed, to be simple is to be great."
          <br><br> - Waldo Emerson
        </blockquote>
          <br>
          <p> Simplicity is the one thing I value more than well-structured code and clean desks.
            When writing software, the question I keep asking myself is; What would a typical user expect from this? That's the starting point. </p>
          <p> Making an experience is about more than conforming to the person's needs or expectations; it's about going beyond that.
              Instead of making something that <u> adds to </u> life, I like to make things that <u> extend </u> our lives.
              To make something truly simplistic, is to make something as if it is what we have always missed. </p>
